# EE 337 Microprocessors Laboratory
It is a core course for undergraduate students studying Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. This course follows closely its theory equivalent EE 309 - Microprocessors.
The contents of this repository are the Spring 2021 version of this course. Even though this lab course has been conducted in an online mode, all the students were delivered the 8051
microcontroller board by mail and all the labs were simulated using Keil and tested using the 8051 board.

The details about the lab sheets and other resources that I used can be found [here](https://ee337.github.io/2021/s2.html){:target="_blank"}.
